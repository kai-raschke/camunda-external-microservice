# camunda-external-microservice
Uses external task client to redirect variable microservices to modules

## microApi

Acts as an interface between Camunda and other microservices and executes simple tasks.
Implemented using the External Task Client from Camunda (https://github.com/camunda/camunda-external-task-client-js).

### Configuration

Default method for setting configurations options is the .env file.

If you are using PM2 as process manager, you can use their ecosystem json file declaration (sample
in app.json.sample). In case of PM2 delete the .env file, because it will overwrite the variables
of PM2.

### Option

| AUTH |  Boolean | X  | false  |   | Use basic auth for REST
| USER |  String | X  | -  |   | Basic auth user
| PASS |  String | X  | -  |   | Basic auth password

### How it works

Place a service task in your BPMN and configure it to use the external microservice (see the sample BPMN).

This service will grab the task and execute the specified module.  
The module is specified as input parameter named "micro-api-module" and as value the filename of the
the module (without extension).

You can set more input variables in the service task to use them directly in the module. Modules
then take care of some service (e.g. Query another API, build a PDF, download stuff etc.).

### Sample

Sample folder holds a BPMN using the "just-complete"-Microservice.
It just completes the service successfully.
